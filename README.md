### Resources

[Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash) - This helped me understand JavaSCript and how to calculate pixels to rem of certain images and shapes and how that corresponded to the internet web page interface. 

### What I learned

I learned how to define styles like .container in order to differentiate the seperate properties from the image, overlay, etc. 

Learning Markdown to become more organized in regard to the README File.
